Officials of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) tracked down three Bangladeshi 
nationals who have been staying illegally in Bengaluruâ€™s Bellandur and handed them over 
to the local police on Friday. On further investigation, it emerged that there are 24 other such 
illegal immigrants in the city, officers said. A search is on to locate them.

The Bengaluru police identified the three illegal immigrants as Khaleel Chaparasi, 
Abdul Khadir and Mohammad Zaheed. They were traced by the NIA during a search operation on Monday.

Officers said the NIA team flew down to Bengaluru to investigate a case with links to Uttar Pradesh. 
However, during the course of the investigation, it came to light that three Bangladeshi nationals 
were illegally living in Bengaluru.

Preliminary probe revealed that the immigrants, who are currently under the custody of the 
jurisdictional Bellandur police, had been staying illegally in the country since 2011. 
The trio entered the country with the help of a broker after paying him Rs 20,000. 
They also managed to get Aadhaar cards, ration cards and other government IDs.
